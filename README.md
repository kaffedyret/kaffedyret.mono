# Welcome to Kaffedyret&reg;

Hello there, curious soul.

This is the source code for the website of Kaffedyret&reg;. The goal of having this repository public is to challenge myself to write easy-to-read, easy-to-understand, simple, and fast-paced code. A part of being a senior developer is understanding when to cut corners. In this project the aim is to spend as little time as possible developing so I have more to roast coffee.

## What the heck is Kaffedyret&reg;?

Kaffedyret&reg; is a nano coffee roastery based in Norway run by Christian and his wife Elisabeth. Christian is a senior frontend developer by day and coffee roaster by night. Oh, and "kaffedyret" is Norwegian for "the coffee animal".

## Cool, so where can I buy coffee?

Head on over to [Kaffedyret.no](https://kaffedyret.no)! We're also on social media:

- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Kaffedyret)

## Enough chit-chat, I'm here because I'm a developer!

Woah there, cowboy. The stack I'm using is based on cutting-edge frameworks like ~~[Remix](https://remix.run)~~ [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com). I don't know what more I can tell ya. This project will develop (pun intended) as we go.

## Okay, you got me. I'm actually just a head hunter

Cool. Thank you for checking out my code. I'm not looking for a new workplace though. So... Have a nice day!
